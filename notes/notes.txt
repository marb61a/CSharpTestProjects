C# Scripting -> Framework
    - .NET Core is needed
        - https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core
        - To check that .net is installed use the following command which should display the version being used
            - dotnet --version
    - Visual Studio Code is used but VS Community or another text editor can be used
        - If using VS Code the C# extension will be needed
        - Another extension being used is PackSharp
    - Once PackSharp is installed it can be used via the command palette
        - CTRL+SHIFT+P
    - In this case the option to be chosen is New Project -> Class Library
        - This will then have to be named and then hit enter
    - The integrated terminal will show the actual command that was used by PackSharp
        - dotnet new classlib --name <project name>
    - If creating projects these will need to be added to the solution file
        - The solution file will actually keep track of all your projects and your projects will keep track of all your dependencies
        - The solution file is rarely opened
        - To add projects to a solution use the following command
            - dotnet sln add <projects name>
    - After adding projects then the solution will have to be built using the following command
        - dotnet build
        - If everything is working there should be a build succeeded message
